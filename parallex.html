            <p class="text"> Bollywood movies are very popular for the “Romance” portrayed in their plot.  Romance in Bollywood has evolved throughout the ages.  But the one thing, that has remained constant are the unofficial and official ban on any depiction that may suggest something which is not a part of the “Indian” culture.  Westernization was always shown as something negative and alien.  Let’s have a closer look at how Hindi cinema deals with this censorship code that has been set up.  Bollywood adopted a new way to recreate the same passion that usually a ‘kiss’ would generate; they substitute these by song and dance routines.

                Rai was raised in a traditional South Indian home and was pursuing an education in architecture when she
                was crowned Miss World in 1994. The title put her on the fast track of the modeling business. She landed
                lucrative jobs with PepsiCo, Inc., and Vogue magazine, and in 2003 she signed on as a spokesmodel for
                L’Oréal Paris. Her acting career began in earnest with acclaimed performances in Iruvar (1997; The Duo)
                and …Aur pyaar ho gaya (1997; based on the 1994 American movie Only You). Both films broke from the
                simplistic structure typical of Bollywood films at the time and helped to push Rai to the forefront of
                the “New Bollywood.” For decades the Indian film industry had produced a large number of very
                predictable and clichéd feature films that were enjoyed almost exclusively by South Asians. Changes in
                Bollywood with regard to financing and production, however, had seen the industry move to improve the
                artistic quality of its product and to expand its audience beyond South Asia.

                Rai returned to Bollywood for the blockbuster Dhoom: 2 (2006) before releasing the English-language
                Provoked: A True Story (2006), the tale of a Punjabi woman imprisoned for murdering her abusive husband.
                In April 2007 she married Abhishek Bachchan, her frequent costar and the son of Bollywood legend Amitabh
                Bachchan, in a union that joined two of the most powerful names in the Indian entertainment industry.
                Rai returned to work in the Arthurian tale The Last Legion (2007). It proved to be a disappointment at
                the box office but was soon overshadowed by the critical and popular success of Jodhaa Akbar (2008), a
                lush historical romance that tells the story of Akbar, the greatest Mughal emperor.

                Rai’s later films included The Pink Panther 2 (2009) and the action romance Enthiran (2010; The Robot).
                In Guzaarish (2010; The Request) she portrayed the nurse of a quadriplegic magician who wishes to
                legally end his life. Following the birth of her daughter in 2011, Rai took a hiatus from acting. She
                returned in 2015 with Jazbaa, a crime drama in which she played a criminal attorney whose daughter is
                kidnapped. The following year she starred in the biopic Sarbjit, about an Indian man held in a Pakistani
                prison on charges of terrorism and espionage. Fanney Khan (2018) was a musical comedy in which a father
                goes to great lengths to make his daughter a famous singer.

                She had to struggle even after Indian Idol to get a strong foothold in the music industry. She got an
                offer from music director Pritam Chakraborty to sing two songs for the Bollywood film Race in 2008 –
                "Khwab Dekhe" (Sexy Lady) and "Zara Zara Touch Me".[10] She was originally scheduled to sing only one
                song, but her first recording impressed the film's directors Abbas–Mustan enough for them to book her a
                second.[4] "Zara Zara Touch Me" was enormously successful, becoming the fourth-most-played song on
                Indian radio during the first half of 2008.[11] She also got nominated for an IIFA Award for Best Female
                Playback and an Apsara Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the song "Zara Zara Touch Me". Monali's
                first large format live concert was at Powai Sarvajanin Durgotsav in 2011.

                In 2014, Thakur won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the song "Sawaar Loon" from
                the film Lootera.[14] In March 2016, she received the National Film Award for Best Female Playback
                Singer for the song "Moh Moh Ke Dhaage" from the film Dum Laga Ke Haisha[15] and earned a nomination at
                the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the same.[16] In 2018, Thakur appeared in the
                Zee5 show Lockdown along with Mickey Singh which was produced by Badshah (rapper)'s production house
                Afterhours. They recreated two tracks, "Jiya Jale" and "Gur Nalon Ishq Meetha"
